Using one slice of a CT angiographic scan:
(a) Draw a profile line through line 256 of this 2D data set.
(b) Calculate the mean value and the variance value of this 2D data set.
(c) Display a histogram of this 2D data set (instead of bars you may use a line
graph to link occurrences along the x-axis).
(d) Rescale values to range between 0 and 255 using a linear transformation.
(e) Rescale values to range between 0 and 255 using a different
(e.g. non-linear) transformation.
(f) Use an 11x11 boxcar smoothing filter on the 2D data set.
(g) Use an 11x11 median filter on the 2D data set.
